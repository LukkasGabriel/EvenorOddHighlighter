# PrimeNumberHighlighter
This Python program takes a user-inputted number and highlights all the prime numbers up to that value using color formatting in the terminal. Prime numbers are displayed in green, while non-prime numbers are shown in red. The script uses ANSI escape codes for colored output, making it visually easy to distinguish prime numbers from others.
